# Trading Strategies Explained

## 1. Momentum Trading

**Idea:**  
Trade stocks that are moving strongly in one direction with high volume.

**How it works:**  
You look for a stock that’s making a strong move (up or down) with big volume — often due to news, earnings, or hype.  
The idea is to “ride the wave” while the momentum lasts.  
You enter once the move is confirmed and exit when signs of weakness or exhaustion appear.

**Common tools & signals:**
- High relative volume (2–10x average)  
- Intraday charts showing strong directional candles  
- Indicators: VWAP, Moving Averages, RSI (to avoid entering when it’s overextended)

**Example:**  
A stock jumps 10% in the first hour after good earnings with volume 5x normal.  
→ You buy after a small pullback and sell as momentum starts to fade.

**Goal:**  
Capture the middle of a strong move — not the very start or end.

## 2. Reversal Trading

**Idea:**  
Trade when a stock is too extended in one direction and likely to snap back.

**How it works:**  
You look for a stock that’s been trending up or down too aggressively — often to “overbought” or “oversold” levels.  
You enter against the trend once there are signs it’s reversing.  
Works best at clear exhaustion points (e.g. spikes on huge volume or failed breakouts).

**Common tools & signals:**
- RSI above 70 (overbought) or below 30 (oversold)  
- Candlestick patterns (hammer, shooting star, engulfing)  
- Divergences (price keeps rising but momentum indicators flatten)  
- Volume spikes signaling blow-off tops or panic selling

**Example:**  
A stock surges 15% in a day on hype, stalls near resistance, and RSI hits 80.  
→ You short it as it starts to pull back toward VWAP.

**Goal:**  
Catch the “snap back” move after an overextended run.

## 3. Breakout Trading

**Idea:**  
Trade when price breaks through a key level of support or resistance.

**How it works:**  
You mark strong price levels (previous highs/lows, consolidation ranges).  
When price breaks through with strong volume, you enter in the direction of the break.  
The theory: once a level breaks, trapped traders and new momentum can push it further.

**Common tools & signals:**
- Support/resistance lines, trendlines  
- Volume spike confirming the breakout  
- Consolidation before the move (tight price range)  
- Confirmation candle closing beyond the level

**Example:**  
Stock trades between $49–$50 for days, then breaks above $50 with a surge in volume.  
→ You buy at $50.10 and sell into the next leg up.

**Goal:**  
Capture strong directional moves when price escapes a range.

## 4. Scalping

**Idea:**  
Make many small trades for tiny profits, often seconds or minutes long.

**How it works:**  
Scalpers look for quick, low-risk setups — small fluctuations in price they can capitalize on.  
Often use Level 2 data and order flow to time entries/exits precisely.  
Focus on liquidity (tight spreads, high volume).

**Common tools & signals:**
- 1-min or tick charts  
- VWAP and short moving averages  
- Hotkeys and direct market access for ultra-fast execution

**Example:**  
Buy 1,000 shares at $10.00, sell at $10.03 — a 3-cent move is $30 profit.  
→ Repeat dozens of times a day.

**Goal:**  
Profit from micro-movements, not big swings.

## 5. Gap Trading

**Idea:**  
Trade the price gap between yesterday’s close and today’s open.

**How it works:**  
Stocks often “gap” up or down at market open due to overnight news or sentiment.  
You trade based on whether the gap will fill (retrace) or continue (extend).

**Two main approaches:**
- **Gap-and-Go:** If a stock gaps up and continues higher with strong volume — trade with the gap.  
- **Gap-Fill:** If the gap is overdone — trade against it, expecting it to close back toward yesterday’s close.

**Common tools & signals:**
- Pre-market scanners for gappers  
- Volume confirmation after open  
- VWAP and opening range breakouts

**Example:**  
Stock closes at $20, opens at $22 after news.  
→ If buyers keep pushing, you buy (Gap-and-Go).  
→ If it quickly fades under VWAP, you short (Gap-Fill).

**Goal:**  
Exploit the volatility and inefficiency of the open.
